## process guidelines   
'use strict'; as your first line of code   
 
wrap your entire function in a closure:   
 
(function () {   

    // your code goes here      

})();   

## naming conventions    
'processes' are named as the name of the process.   

os files are named based on their structure for example:   
os.fs.read.js   
os.fs.write.js   
os.ps.scheduler.js
